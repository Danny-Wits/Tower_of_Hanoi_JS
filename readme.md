# Tower of Hanoi Visualizer ðŸŽ¨

## Overview

This project is an **interactive Tower of Hanoi Visualizer** built using **p5.js**.
It demonstrates the classic recursive algorithm and visually shows how disks are moved between towers to solve the puzzle.

## Features

* Built with **p5.js** for smooth graphics and animations
* Adjustable number of disks and towers
* Customizable animation speed
* Move counter display
* Simple and clean UI with light theme

## Technologies Used

* **HTML / CSS** â€“ UI and layout
* **p5.js** â€“ Graphics and animation logic
* **JavaScript (ES6)** â€“ Recursive Tower of Hanoi algorithm

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Adjust disk count, speed, and tower count from the control panel.
4. Click **Solve** to watch the algorithm in action.

## Future Enhancements

* Add support for Frameâ€“Stewart algorithm (multi-peg version)
* Step-by-step explanation of recursion
* Sound effects and improved visuals
