# Tower of Hanoi Visualizer

## Overview

This project is an **interactive Tower of Hanoi Visualizer** built using **p5.js**.
It demonstrates both the **classic 3-peg recursive algorithm** and the **Frame–Stewart algorithm** for multiple pegs, providing a visual and educational experience of how disks are moved step-by-step to solve the puzzle.

## Features

* Built with **p5.js** for smooth, real-time graphics and animations
* Supports **both Classic (3-peg)** and **Frame–Stewart (multi-peg)** solutions
* Adjustable **number of disks** and **tower count**
* Customizable **animation speed**
* **Move counter** to track progress
* **Audio feedback** on each disk move for an engaging experience
* Simple and clean **light-themed UI**

## Technologies Used

* **HTML / CSS** – Interface and layout
* **p5.js** – Graphics and rendering
* **JavaScript (ES6)** – Core logic for recursive and Frame–Stewart algorithms
* **Audio API** – For disk movement sound effects

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Adjust **disk count**, **speed**, and **tower count** using the control panel.
4. Choose between **Classic** or **Frame–Stewart** mode.
5. Click **Solve** to watch the puzzle come to life with sound and motion.
